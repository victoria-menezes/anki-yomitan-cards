# About
Cards made for personal use for Anki and Yomitan, specifically for japanese study.
The goal is to achieve clear, informative cards requiring as little user-input as possible to incentivize vocabulary-mining.

## Card types
### Standard
Vocabulary in front, definitions and such on the back. Buttons allow for sentences (if available) or furigana to be viewed before answering.
### Fill-in
Sentences with a word censored, and the word's definition next to them. Definitions on the back.
### Kanji
Kanji in front, and definitions, mnemonics, readings etc on the back. 
Radicals and mnemonics must be sourced by the user.
### Grammar
For grammar-points. So far the only card type to still be completely manual, as there is no dictionary to suit my needs.

## Debugging
